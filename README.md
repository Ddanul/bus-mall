> Week 3 project - Code Fellows

* First Day is creating a voting system that dynamically displays three images that a user can click on.  The program is to keep count of the number of times an image is selected as well as how many times it is displayed.  Once the user clicks 25 times, the results of the voting should be displayed.

* Second day is to add a chart using ChartJS to show the results in a different way.  I also added some styling to the page.
